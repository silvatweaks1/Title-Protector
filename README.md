## Overview

Title Protector is a lightweight defensive layer that checks active window titles and terminates the application if a blocked title is detected.

This is not a robust protection method. It is intended only as an additional layer.

---

## How It Works

- Monitors the titles of currently opened windows  
- Compares them against a configurable blocklist  
- Terminates the application when a match is found  

Example blocklist:

```txt
x64dbg
dnSpy
IDA
ILSpy
Process Hacker
Cheat Engine
```

---

## Configuration

The blocklist is fully editable.  
No external dependencies.  
Simple and lightweight by design.
